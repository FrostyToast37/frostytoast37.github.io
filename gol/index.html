    <h1>Conway's Game of Life</h1>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>
      -Click the cells to make them alive<br>
      -Once you have the cells that you want alive, press the start button to begin the simulation<br>
      -When you want to change something click the stop button, and then you can start again once you've made the changes<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Rules</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>-Underpopulation:</strong> A live cell with fewer than two living neighbors dies in the next generation. <br>
      <strong>-Survival:</strong> A live cell with two or three living neighbors survives to the next generation. <br>
      <strong>-Overpopulation:</strong> A live cell with more than three living neighbors dies in the next generation. <br> 
      <strong>-Reproduction:</strong> A dead cell with exactly three living neighbors becomes alive in the next generation. <br>
