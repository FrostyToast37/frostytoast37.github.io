var gate_d = "You see an old, twisted, metal gate, from which, a winding path leads north.";
var path_d = "Along the old dirt path you spy the door to a giant mansion to the north through the fog.";
var door_d = "You encounter a massive set of oak doors with a sign above them saying 'The Hydrangea Hotel'. However, spraypainted all around the doors are warnings not to go in. Do you proceed north through the doors?";
var mainRoom_d = "A gargantuan main lobby welcomes you in. There is a welcome desk to the west, a stairway to the north, and a hallway to the east.";
var mainStairsZ1_d = "Large wooden stairs loom, leading up to the next floor, and tinted windows cover the walls.";
var frontDesk_d = "A large wooden desk slouches in the corner of a dark room with a sign on it saying 'W lco e'. Around it are dingy couches with suitcases littered around. To your north is a hallway, while to the east is the main lobby and west leads into a closet."
var deskCloset_d = "The closet contains old, rotting coats, the strong smell of mildew, and boots on the floor in neat rows. Cobwebs fill the room and various items are in a state of dissarray. You can hardly see anything, and that is with the door open. Back to the east is the welcome area."
var secretRoom_d =  "The secret door swings open loudly, the rust falling off as the inside reveals a plain room. The walls are filled with shelves with books, and a single table sits in the middle. There are torches along the walls and on the table sits a plain, metal chest with a rusty lock."
var X5Y3h_d = "The hallway looks the same as every other: medieval architecture and glowing ethereal torches. The hallway continues to the east, and to the west is the main lobby."
var X6Y3h_d = "The hallway looks the same as every other: medieval architecture and glowing ethereal torches. The hallway continues to the north and west, and the east opens up into a room."
var diningRoom_d = "An abandoned dining room has torches along the walls, chairs and dishes strewn along the room, and a twisted wooden table in the midst of the clutter. There is a hallway to the west and another room to the east."
var kitchen_d = "You can clearly see this room was once a kitchen, as pots, pans, and dishes are found in sinks around the area. The room is in disarray, with rotting food thrown across the room, creating a horrible smell. There are rooms to your north, south, and west. As you enter, something that can only be described as a ghost attacks. He is wearing a white apron and has a corrupted bow in front. Before you can move, he loads an arrow and fires, narrowly missing you and slamming the door behind you shut. Your only option now is to fight."
var porch_d = "As you walk in, a clearly recognizable bloody shirt is on the floor, along with dusty footprints that look fresh. This room is clearly a porch, and it has a ripped screen netting around it. Back to your north is the kitchen."
var pantry_d = "The first thing that you recognize as you walk in is the smell. A combination of blood, rot, and death provides your nose with a reason to fall off your face. You see blood splattered across the room, along with gashes in the wall and rotting food along the floor. Back to the south is the kitchen."
var X6Y4h_d = "The hallway looks the same as every other: medieval architecture and glowing ethereal torches. The hallway continues to the south and there is a room to the north."
var lounge_d = "Once, the couch that greets your eyes might be considered comfy, but with the amount of gashes, dust, and mildew on it, you don't feel comfortable trying it anymore. There are bookshelves around the room, and the room looks mostly untouched over the years. There is a hallway to the south and a room to the east."
var pool_d = "An abandoned dry pit in the middle of this room grabs your attention. After careful consideration, you realize this must have been a pool. Around the room, there are towels with mildew and swim trunks. Back to your west is the lounge."

var greenhouse_d = "The room is covered in cracked, stained, dirty glass panes. You can spot glimpses of the woods that sorround you out of them. Plants cover the walls, ceiling, and floor and grow out of their containers as they spread around the room. Back to the east is the hallway."
var X1Y5h_d = "The hallway looks the same as every other: medieval architecture and glowing ethereal torches. The hallway continues to the north and south."
var X1Y6h_d = "The hallway looks the same as every other: medieval architecture and glowing ethereal torches. The hallway continues to the south and there is a room to the east."
var secretRoom2_d = "The door swings open quietly, the hinges well oiled. When it opens, you see an altar made of cracked stone. It is surrounded in an otherworldly light, and you feel drawn to it. As you walk over in a trance, the light suddenly shuts out, the room darkens noticeably and you hear the screaming of thousands, simultaneously saying 'YOU ARE NOT WORTHY! LEAVE NOW, MORTAL FOOL, OR RISK ETERNAL JUDGEMENT!' Do you exit back to the east?"
var mapRoom_d = "The room is filled wall to wall with maps. Maps of the universe, of the world, and of the manor. All the mpas are old and fragile, meaning you can't read or pick them up. However, one of the maps has a note scribbled on the bottom corner: 'do not enter the room due west'."
var secretRoom3_d = "You slide past the map to the east and enter a secret room. This room contains absolutely nothing except for a small chair with a book on top. A single torch is fitted into the wall on one side."
