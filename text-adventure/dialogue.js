In front of a closet door a box of shotgun shells rests on the ground. To your north is a hallway, while to the east is the main lobby and west leads into the closet.";

The room is in disarray, with rotting food thrown across the room, creating a horrible smell. There are rooms to your north, south, and west. As you enter, something that can only be described as a ghost attacks. He is wearing a white apron and has a corrupted bow in front. Before you can move, he loads an arrow and fires, narrowly missing you and slamming the door behind you shut. Your only option now is to fight.";
